# BomBoi
BomBoi is a local multiplayer game inspired by Bomberman and similar titles. 

### What makes BomBoi unique?
BomBoi uses the [Totality framework](https://github.com/tommy1019/Totality) for multiplayer. This means that the game runs on a single computer and users can connect and play using their smartphones. BomBoi could theoretically support hundreds of players at once (but this has never been tested).

BomBoi supports maps created with [Tiled map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/). You can create your own maps and play them with your friends!

BomBoi also supports custom tilesets. This means you can change the appearance of any level in the game.

### What other features are planned?
I have a lot of features planned for BomBoi. The most notable are:

* Multiple characters with different bombs and abilities
* Scoreboards and leaderboards
* Persistent profiles with statistics tracking
* Singleplayer game modes (maybe)

Please note: BomBoi is a hobby project made by one person. Development may be slow and sporadic.
